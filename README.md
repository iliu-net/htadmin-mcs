# HTAdmin

HTAdmin is a simple htpasswd editor implemented in PHP with a nice
frontend (based on bootstrap). It's intended to update and maintain
users and password hashes in a .htpasswd file. The admin has to create
a user, but every user can change his password by himself using a
self service area.

You can use the .htpasswd with nginx and Apache.

PHP needs write permission for the `.htpasswd` file.

Create a config.ini within `config` from the included example
file `config.ini.example`.

Enjoy!
